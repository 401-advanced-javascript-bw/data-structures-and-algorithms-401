# Reverse an Array

Produce an array in reverse order.

## Challenge

Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument. Return an array in reverse order without using any built-in methods available to your language.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used a for loop starting from the end of the array and appending each item to an empty array, decreasing the position of i each time.
